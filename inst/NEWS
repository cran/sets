Changes to 1.0-1:

 o interval class for possibly infinite numeric intervals added.

 o fuzzy rules now accept the use of brackets in the expressions.

 o Missing memberships are now supported.

Changes to 1.0:

 o JSS article as vignette added.

 o fuzzy_pi4() generator added.

 o [gc]set_memberships extended to allow for filter elements and
   to work with tuples.

Changes to 0.7:

 o L1 and L2 dissimilarities for fuzzy multisets added.

 o fuzzy_pi() - generator added

 o (fuzzy) multisets are now n-bounded (n = maximal multiplicity).
   This now allows consistent complement-building.

 o nu-cuts added (filters elements according to multiplicity).

 o fuzzy inference framework added

 o converters for matrices added

Changes to 0.5:

  o bug fixes in ordering function and as.character.cset

Changes to 0.4:

  o fuzzy function generators added

  o extended plotting for fuzzy sets added

Changes to 0.2-1:

  o set_options() added

Changes to 0.2:

  o A *lot* of bug fixes
  o closure and reduction of sets added

Changes to 0.1:

  o Initial release, implementing data structures and methods for
    * ordinary sets
    * generalized sets (fuzzy sets, multisets, fuzzy multisets)
    * as well as support for fuzzy logic.
